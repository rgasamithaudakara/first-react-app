The character was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, and first appeared in Action Comics #1, a comic book published on April 18, 1938.[1] The character regularly appears in comic books published by DC Comics, and has been adapted to a number of radio serials, movies, and television shows. Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His foster parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias \\'Superman\\' when fighting crime. Clark Kent resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and editor-in-chief Perry White. His most well-known villain is Lex Luthor. Superman is part of the DC Universe, and as such often appears in stories alongside other DC Universe heroes such as Batman and Wonder Woman.\",\n    email: \"super.man@example.com\",\n    dob: {\n      date: \"1753-07-20T09:44:18.674Z\"\n    },\n    picture: {\n      medium: require(\"./Images/user001.jpg\")\n    }\n  }, {\n    id: 2,\n    name: {\n      title: \"Mr\",\n      first: \"Bat\",\n      last: \"Man\"\n    },\n    location: {\n      city: \"Ghothem City\"\n    },\n    description: \"Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

Originally named the \\\"Bat-Man,\\\" the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective. Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a genius-level intellect and is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of weaponry and equipment. A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his nemesis, the Joker.\",\n    email: \"bat.man@example.com\",\n    dob: {\n      date: \"1970-08-23T01:14:28.374Z\"\n    },\n    picture: {\n      medium: require(\"./Images/user002.jpg\")\n    }\n  }, {\n    id: 3,\n    name: {\n      title: \"Mr\",\n      first: \"Aqua\",\n      last: \"Man\"\n    },\n    location: {\n      city: \"Colombo\"\n    },\n    description: \"Aquaman (Arthur Curry) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series. During the late 1950s' and 1960s' superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League. In the 1990s' Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis. The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, making Aquaman widely recognized in popular culture and one of the world's most recognized superheroes. Jokes about his wholesome, weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines, leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books. Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, saddled with an ill reputation, and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.\",\n    email: \"aqua.man@example.com\",\n    dob: {\n      date: \"1977-12-22T01:14:28.374Z\"\n    },\n    picture: {\n      medium: require(\"./Images/user003.jpg\")\n    }\n  }, {\n    id: 4,\n    name: {\n      title: \"Miss\",\n      first: \"Wonder\",\n      last: \"Woman\"\n    },\n    location: {\n      city: \"Miami\"\n    },\n    description: \"Wonder Woman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of the Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star Comics #8 in October 1941[1] with her first feature in Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942. The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986.[3] In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira. When blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince. Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter. Marston's wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's appearance. Marston's comics featured his ideas on DISC theory, and the character drew a great deal of inspiration from early feminists, and especially from birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger; in particular, her piece \\\"Woman and the New Race\\\". Wonder Woman's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life to live as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In recent years, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe.\",\n    email:

Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin. His foster parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias \\'Superman\\' when fighting crime. Clark Kent resides in the fictional American city of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet. Superman's supporting characters include his love interest and fellow journalist Lois Lane, Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen and editor-in-chief Perry White. His most well-known villain is Lex Luthor. Superman is part of the DC Universe, and as such often appears in stories alongside other DC Universe heroes such as Batman and Wonder Woman.\",\n      email: \"super.man@example.com\",\n      dob: {\n        date: \"1753-07-20T09:44:18.674Z\",\n      },\n      picture: {\n        medium: require(\"./Images/user001.jpg\"),\n      },\n    },\n\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      name: {\n        title: \"Mr\",\n        first: \"Bat\",\n        last: \"Man\",\n      },\n      location: {\n        city: \"Ghothem City\",\n      },\n      description: \"Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice. Bruce trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any inhuman superpowers. He does, however, possess a genius-level intellect and is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of weaponry and equipment.

Created by Paul Norris and Mort Weisinger, the character debuted in More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941). Initially a backup feature in DC's anthology titles, Aquaman later starred in several volumes of a solo comic book series. During the late 1950s' and 1960s' superhero-revival period known as the Silver Age, he was a founding member of the Justice League. In the 1990s' Modern Age, writers interpreted Aquaman's character more seriously, with storylines depicting the weight of his role as king of Atlantis. The character's original 1960s animated appearances left a lasting impression, making Aquaman widely recognized in popular culture and one of the world's most recognized superheroes. Jokes about his wholesome, weak portrayal in Super Friends and perceived feeble powers and abilities have been staples of comedy programs and stand-up routines, leading DC at several times to attempt to make the character edgier or more powerful in comic books. Modern comic book depictions have attempted to reconcile these various aspects of his public perception, with many versions often casting Aquaman as serious and brooding, saddled with an ill reputation, and struggling to find a true role and purpose beyond his public side as a deposed king and a fallen hero.\",\n            email: \"aqua.man@example.com\",\n      dob: {\n        date: \"1977-12-22T01:14:28.374Z\",\n      },\n      picture: {\n        medium: require(\"./Images/user003.jpg\"),\n      },\n    },\n\n    {\n      id: 4,\n      name: {\n        title: \"Miss\",\n        first: \"Wonder\",\n        last: \"Woman\",\n      },\n      location: {\n        city: \"Miami\",\n      },\n      description: \"Wonder Woman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is a founding member of the Justice League. The character first appeared in All Star Comics #8 in October 1941[1] with her first feature in Sensation Comics #1 in January 1942. The Wonder Woman title has been published by DC Comics almost continuously except for a brief hiatus in 1986.[3] In her homeland, the island nation of Themyscira, her official title is Princess Diana of Themyscira. When blending into the society outside of her homeland, she sometimes adopts her civilian identity Diana Prince. Wonder Woman was created by the American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston (pen name: Charles Moulton), and artist Harry G. Peter. Marston's wife, Elizabeth, and their life partner, Olive Byrne, are credited as being his inspiration for the character's appearance. Marston's comics featured his ideas on DISC theory, and the character drew a great deal of inspiration from early feminists, and especially from birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger; in particular, her piece \\\"Woman and the New Race\\\". Wonder Woman's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and was given a life to live as an Amazon, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods. In recent years, DC changed her background with the retcon that she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, jointly raised by her mother and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe.\",\n      email: \"wonder.woman@example.com\",\n      dob: {\n        date: \"1898-01-01T09:44:18.674Z\",\n      },\n      picture: {\n        medium: require(\"./Images/user004.jpg\"),\n      },\n    },\n  ];\n\n  const nameListComponent = () => {\n    return nameList.map((card) => {\n      return (\n        <ListItem\n          key={card.id}\n          name={`${card.name.first} ${card.name.last}`}\n          city={card.location.city}\n          email={card.email}\n          birthday={moment(card.dob.date).format(\"L\")}\n          avatar={card.picture.medium}\n          description={card.description}\n        />\n      );\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <React.Fragment>\n      <div className=\"PageColor\">\n        <NavBar />\n        <div\n          id=\"carouselExampleIndicators\"\n          className=\"carousel slide Carousel\"\n          data-ride=\"carousel\"\n        >\n          <ol className=\"carousel-indicators\">\n            <li\n              data-target=\"#carouselExampleIndicators\"\n              data-slide-to=\"0\"\n              className=\"active\"\n            ></li>\n            <li data-target=\"#carouselExampleIndicators\" data-slide-to=\"1\"></li>\n            <li data-target=\"#carouselExampleIndicators\" data-slide-to=\"2\"></li>\n          </ol>\n          <div className=\"carousel-inner\">\n            <div className=\"carousel-item active\">\n              <img src={cover01} className=\"d-block w-100 Slider\" alt=\"...\" />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"carousel-item\">\n              <img src={cover02} className=\"d-block w-100 Slider\" alt=\"...\" />\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"carousel-item\">\n              <img src={cover03} className=\"d-block w-100 Slider\" alt=\"...\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <a\n            className=\"carousel-control-prev\"\n            href=\"#carouselExampleIndicators\"\n            role=\"button\"\n            data-slide=\"prev\"\n          >\n            <span\n              className=\"carousel-control-prev-icon\"\n              aria-hidden=\"true\"\n            ></span>\n            <span className=\"sr-only\">Previous</span>\n          </a>\n          <a\n            className=\"carousel-control-next\"\n            href=\"#carouselExampleIndicators\"\n            role=\"button\"\n            data-slide=\"next\"\n          >\n            <span\n              className=\"carousel-control-next-icon\"\n              aria-hidden=\"true\"\n            ></span>\n            <span className=\"sr-only\">Next</span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"Container\">\n          <div className=\"Page\">{nameListComponent()}</div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <MDBFooter color=\"blue\" className=\"font-small pt-4 mt-4\">\n      <MDBContainer fluid className=\"text-center text-md-left\">\n        <MDBRow>\n          <MDBCol md=\"6\">\n            <h5 className=\"title\">Footer Content</h5>\n            <p>\n              Here you can use rows and columns here to organize your footer\n              content.\n            </p>\n          </MDBCol>\n          <MDBCol md=\"6\">\n            <h5 className=\"title\">Links</h5>\n            <ul>\n              <li className=\"list-unstyled\">\n                <a href=\"#!\">Link 1</a>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"list-unstyled\">\n                <a href=\"#!\">Link 2</a>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"list-unstyled\">\n                <a href=\"#!\">Link 3</a>\n              </li>\n              <li className=\"list-unstyled\">\n                <a href=\"#!\">Link 4</a>\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n          </MDBCol>\n        </MDBRow>\n      </MDBContainer>\n      <div className=\"footer-copyright text-center py-3\">\n        <MDBContainer fluid>\n          &copy; {new Date().getFullYear()} Copyright: <a href=\"https://www.mdbootstrap.com\"> MDBootstrap.com </a>\n        </MDBContainer>\n      </div>\n    </MDBFooter>\n    </React.Fragment>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
